# E-commerce Apparel Store feat. React & GraphQL

#### Author: Jarid Warren [ <jaridwarren@gmail.com> ]

A sample e-commerce store, 'Sick Fits', that allows users to sign-up, add/edit/remove items to the store, and even check-out items with a (test-mode) credit card purchase. 

## Motivation

Sickfits is an opportunity to learn more about React, GraphQL and a host of other modern technologies (listed below) to stay on the cutting edge of web development. In addition, I've wanted to build a fully-functioning E-commerce website with payment processing and an email server to improve my back-end skills.

## Technology

### Front-end

- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering, application routing, and tooling (built on Webpack)
- **React.js**: Client-side front-end UI framework
- **Apollo Client**: GraphQL queries and mutations, cacheing, and managing application state

### Back-end

- **GraphQL Yoga**: Database layer used to resolve Queries and Mutations, credit card charges with [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com), permissions/authentication
- **Express/node.js**: Server framework underneath Yoga (which includes an email server)
- **Prisma**: CRUD APIs that can integrate with many databases (including postreSQL, mongoDB or mySQL), as well as schema definition
